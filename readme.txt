// Fork 1 - risk
Here I'm going to add a bunch of lifechanging, project modifying, potentially harmful code that I'm not sure if I want to keep.

180508 mybranch - some other changes here too

// Fork 1b - more risk

Here is more risk I'm unsure I want.

180508 master - 

180508 master - // Fork 2 - MyBranch specific changes.
Extremely risky and specific to me, while someone else works on master

180508 master - // Conflict - master has 3, MyBranch has 4
Change 3
change 4

// Some master changes right here

180508 mybranch - and probably down here too
180508 mybranch - 
180508 mybranch - and maybe here
180508 mybranch -
