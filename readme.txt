// Fork 1 - risk
Here I'm going to add a bunch of lifechanging, project modifying, potentially harmful code that I'm not sure if I want to keep.

// Fork 1b - more risk
Here is more risk I'm unsure I want.

// Fork 2 - MyBranch specific changes.
Extremely risky and specific to me, while someone else works on master
